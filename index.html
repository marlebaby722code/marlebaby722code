    <h2>Welcome to the World of 722</h2>
    <p>
      MarleBaby is an artist driven by purpose. Through danceable, uplifting,
      and deeply real music, he transforms pain into power and dull moments
      into joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sound speaks to the trench kids — young ones growing up with little,
      yet carrying big dreams. It reminds them that survival is strength,
      belief is fuel, and consistency can change any story.

        <h2>The Origin of the Code</h2>
        <p>
          One night, MarleBaby dreamt of a number: <strong>722</strong>.
          It stayed with him — not as coincidence, but as direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spiritually, 722 represents clarity, vision, guidance, and protection —
          the ability to see ahead and know what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          On <strong>November 7, 2022</strong>, he lost his mentor,
          <strong>Dablixx Osha</strong>, whose influence shaped his journey.
        </p>
        <p class="math">
          November 7, 2022 → 7 / 2022 → remove “20” → <strong>722</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          From that moment, 722 stopped being just a number.
        </p>
